### Clean Code Summary

#### Naming

- use intention revealing names: `raduis` instead of `r`

- don't use abbreviations

- `name` is better than `nameString` (unnecessary informations)

- clear distinctions: avoid `getAcount`, `getAccounts`, `getAccountInfo` in the same class or e.g avoid `get`, `fetch`, `retrieve`

- use pronouncable and meaningful names

- searchable names ( can be found easily by search tools as per their meaning)

- avoid encodings (coded names)

- minimize the usage of prefixes like `addr_name`

- classes and objects should have noun or noun phrase names like `Customer`, `Account`

- methods should have verb or verb phrase name like `postPayment`, `deletePage`

- don't use cute or humorous or witty names

- accessors, mutators, and predicates should be named for their value and prefixed with `get`, `set`, and `is`.

- use names related to the solution applied like the pattern used e.g. factory , builder.

- if not possible relate it to the problem being solved, like relate variables to address e.g. `addressName`, `addressNumber` etc.

- add meaningful context, like creating a class which will hold the variables that are being used in the same context, this will make the variables belong to that class and thus have contextual meaning.


#### Function & Methods

- functions should be small: one line, two,three or four maximum

- This means that `if` statements, `for` loops and `while` loops, should be one line long, obviously this line should be calling another function.

- for `switch` statements, every case should have one line, usually a call to another function.

- indentation level in functions should not be bigger than one or two levels.

- functions should do only one thing

- functions shouldn't have side effects

- function names should be descriptive, don't be afraid to make them very long as long as they are descriptive.

- be consistent in naming the functions, meaning, don't make `includeName()`, `addAdress()`, instead: `includeName()`, `includeAdress()`, Or, `addName()`, `addAdress()`.

- code should be like telling a story, can be read as a top down narrative, every function leading to the next one smoothly .

- every function should have one level of abstraction, the other level should be in another function that follows the first one

- we should never use output arguments in functions, i.e. functions that takes a variable as its argument, then change its state, it is very confusing.

- it is better that functions shouldn't have arguments at all!, or at least one argument, three arguments maximum.

- don't return a boolean as a validation for the successful operation of a function.

- A try and catch block should exist alone in one function i.e. error handling is one thing to do, as we have said previously, functions should do only one thing.


#### Comments

- comments are a necessary evil, we should be writing functions in a descriptive way, so that we can avoid writing comments at all, so the ideal case is that there should be no comments at all!.

- comments should be used only as an explanation , never add obsolete code as a comment, instead remove it and depend on version control systems to preserve the history of the code.

- `TODO` comments are ok because the IDE can find them easily before ending the project.

- don't write redundant comments, if the code is self explanatory no need to add comments.

- instead of using comments as function headers, replace them with a descriptive name for the function if possible.

- instead of writing a comment to explain a long line of code, divide this line into more simpler lines by using local variables so as to make the code more descriptive and readable.

- attribute comments like: `/* added by john smith on 1/10..*/` are ok but not to be a MISLEADING info or to be excessive.

- donâ€™t put interesting historical discussions or irrelevant descriptions of details into your comments

- don't put comments that have poor or no connection to the code it explains.


#### Formating

- *Vertical Formatting*: The file length in lines should be around the size of : 200-500 lines, this is not mandatory off course , but to be followed whenever possible.

- *Vertical Opennes*: Methods should be separated by blank lines, also lines of code that differ in functionality should be separated by blank lines.

- on the other hand: Vertical density (no blank lines) implies close link or association.

- *Vertical distance*: Concepts that are closely related should be kept vertically close to each other , e.g. methods of similar functions or of related function should be grouped and ordered together We want to avoid forcing our readers to hop around through our source files and classes.

- variable declarations inside methods should be as close as possible to their usages.

- instance variable declarations should be in one location and most preferably on the top of the class, or at least in the bottom.

- *Dependent Functions*: If one function calls another, they should be vertically close, and the caller should be above the callee, if at all possible.

- *Conceptual Affinity*: Certain bits of code want to be near other bits, The stronger that affinity, the less vertical distance there should be between them. Affinity might be caused because a group of functions perform a similar operation

- *Horizontal Formatting*: lines should be of the sizes 100-120-max 200 characters.

- indentation should be used to show different levels of hierarchy in the file.

- don't break the indentation rule even in the case of short If statements or short methods.


#### Objects and Data Structures

- in that context, the `data structure class`, exposes its data (variables) and have no meaningful (significant) methods or functions.

- while a `normal class` (Called Object here by the author after Object oriented), like `MainActivity`, `ListAdapter`, `Calculator`, `Iterator`, hides their data, and exposes their methods that work on those data.


#### Error Handling

- there must be a good amount of separation between your business logic code and your error handling code.

- too much error handling is not good, don't use `If` statements instead of `try and catch` blocks.

- try to provide context with exceptions, i.e. Create informative error messages and pass them along with your exceptions. Mention the operation that failed and the type of failure.

- if you are using logging in your application, pass along enough information to be able to log the error in your catch.

- if we have a method that in some cases will return a value/object that might cause an error, usually we will surround the output from this method with try and catch, but, as a better practice, we should refactor this method to always return an error-free value/object.

- don't return `null`, don't pass `null` to methods

#### Boundary

- in third-party code, to avoid passing objects, APIs look forward in order to keep things in the same class.

- performs tests on the API's third party.

- study the documentation and test the third API before you start using it.

- check well the features you will use.

- these steps can help increase yield when there are new updates to the API and you can only run your tests to check for this update.

- create tests the functionality of the API.

#### Unit Testing

- make sure each piece of code is doing what you expect it to do.

- follow the TDDs law:
  * don't create code before you have a failing test.
  * don't create more tests than necessary to fail.
  * you cannot write more code than enough to pass the test that is failing.

- keep your test clean.

- the tests must undergo changes in the same way that the code.

- the dirtier the code, the more difficult test will be to maintain.

- use the F.I.R.S.T rule for testing:
  * the test is fast-running.
  * the tests are independent of other.
  * the test is repeatable in various environments.
  * the test is self-validating.
  * the test is timely.

- The test is as important as the production code.

#### Classes

- the class name should represent your responsibility.

- the class must have only one responsibility.

- to know the size of the class is ideal or we should not measure her responsibility.

- you should try to make a brief description of the class.

- the methods should be:
  * small
  * and even lower
  * they must have only one responsibility

#### Systems

- it is important to recognize and separate responsibilities of a system.

- it should be separate and modularize the logic execution, allowing an independent strategy for solving application dependency.

- is important to take care of dependency injections and to allow only objects to take care of the business of logic.

- it is very difficult to create a system properly first. It must be made available to the story, then refactored, and then expanded to continue implementing new stories.

- to get to the point that TDD is necessary, you need refactoring and clean code.

- we must build POJOs-based logic through testing and evolve from simple to interconnect the various aspects necessary.

#### Emergence

Here are the rules that are given by Kent Beck to create good designs:

- *Run All Tests*. They verify that the system behaves as expected.

- *Eliminate Duplication* because duplicate code brings additional work.

- *Minimize The Number of Classes and Methods*. Following this pattern can ignore it if the classes are very small.

- *Apply All Knowledge to Improve the Design During Refactoring*. Increase cohesion, reduce coupling, separate responsibilities, reduce classes and methods, choose the best names.

- even applying it once, you will not be able to have good software. You need to do this over and over again to achieve continuous improvement.

#### Successive Refinement

- the code-only work is not enough to have a good code.

- professionals who care only about the code that works cannot be considered professional.

- we should ignore that we have no time to refactor to one code. The code that was not taken care of today can become a problem after becoming a problem for the team because no one will want to mess with it.

- try not to let the code rot. It is much cheaper to create a clean code than cleaning a rotten code, as a move in a tangle can be an arduous task.

- the solution, then, comes down to maintaining the cleanest code possible and as simply as possible without ever letting it begin to rot.

#### JUnit

- look to cover tests each (not every method, but each code line).

- no code is immune to improvement, and each of us has a responsibility to make the code a little better than we found it.

- refactoring is an iterative process full of trial and error, inevitably converging to something that we feel is worthy of a professional.

#### Refactoring

- before making any kind of refactoring, it is important to have good coverage tests.

- after increasing or creating test coverage, you can begin to leave the clearest code and fix some bugs.

- now, after leaving the code clearer, someone else can probably clean it even more.

#### Conclusion

Professionalism and craftsmanship come from values and discipline in lists of what you should and should not do when creating a code.
